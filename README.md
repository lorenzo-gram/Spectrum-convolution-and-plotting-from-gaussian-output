# Spectrum-convolution-and-plotting-from-gaussian-output

This python code is useful to plot the result of a tddft calculation performed by Gaussian.
It works with either one output file or more output files. In the latter case, the script will perform a convolution of the spectra by plotting a gaussian function around each excitation (whose intensity is proportional to the oscillator strength) energy and summing up all the gaussian functions.
